here is no doubt that monitoring vital signs and supervising
our health statue is very necessary and critical thing,
especially important organs in our body like our heart,
that could be considered as the engine of the whole body and
we can deduce alot from its condition through many
parameters, one of the most important of parameter is the heart
rate.
It’s known that there is some traditional methods to measure
the heart rate, such as Electrocardiography (ECG that offers
most accurate HR measurement, but require attaching medical
electrodes to the person also pulse oximeter which based on
photoplethysmography (PPG), must be attached to body
part, like toes or an earlobe. Although these methods are
efficient it also needs a high cost and it’s kind of hard to reach,
especially according to the current quarantine situations. So the
orientation now is going to the contactless camera based
monitoring which called remote photoplethysmography
(RPPG)
